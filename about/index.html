            <h2>Design, Motion & Creative</h2>

            <p>
                Hello, I am a passionate creative based in London and Norwich —
                dedicated to my projects and always hoping to learn. From time
                to time I create artwork, which allows me to stay creative and
                have a good knowledge of coding and computers, having designed
                and developed this website from scratch. I try to stay active as
                much as I can and I enjoy running, swimming and bouldering.
            </p>

            <p>
                My creative journey began at age 10 with an inital interest in
                doodles and drawings, which evolved into creating comics by 13.
                I expanded my hobbies into coding when I was 14, which quickly
                evolved into game design when I was 15. I developed my
                appreciation for fine arts untill I was 18, before going to
                university to study Graphic Communication, where I am now.
            </p>

            <p>
                My years of experimenting with hobbies has allowed me to stretch
                my way of thinking and push the boundaries of creative projects.
                Being creative is what I am passionate about, and I love that I
                can continue to push creativity through new mediums in my design
                work. I am a well-rounded designer, but I specialise in motion
                and ideas. I can't wait to meet you!
            </p>
