            <p>
                My creative journey began at age 10 with an inital interest in
                doodles and drawings, which evolved into creating comics by 13.
                I expanded my hobbies into coding when I was 14, which quickly
                evolved into game design when I was 15. I developed my
                appreciation for fine arts untill I was 18, before exploring the
                world of graphic design, which is the field I am in now.

                Hi, Iâ€™m Jacob, a 20 year old designer in London and Norwich. I
                am passionate, energetic and creative, dedicated to my projects
                and always wanting to learn. From time to time I still create
                art pieces and still have a good knowledge of coding and
                computers, having designed and developed this website from
                scratch. I have a knowledgable understanding of a wide variety
                of music, while I also stay active through running and
                bouldering.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                I have already gained experience in the industry, which can be
                seen in my portfolio of work. I have found success so far by
                developing myself as a designer, working hard and networking
                tirelessly to continue to look for oppurtunities.
