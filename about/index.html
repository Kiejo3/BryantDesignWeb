            <p>
                Hi, I’m Jacob, a 21 year old designer in London and Norwich. I
                am passionate, energetic and creative, dedicated to my projects
                and always hoping to learn. From time to time I still create art
                pieces and still have a good knowledge of coding and computers,
                having designed and developed this website from scratch. I try
                to stay active as much as I can and I enjoy running, swimming
                and bouldering.
            </p>

            <p>
                My creative journey began at age 10 with an inital interest in
                doodles and drawings, which evolved into creating comics by 13.
                I expanded my hobbies into coding when I was 14, which quickly
                evolved into game design when I was 15. I developed my
                appreciation for fine arts untill I was 18, before exploring the
                world of graphic design, which is the field I am in now.
