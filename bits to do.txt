what am I going to do for the team name and links tags? where do I put them?

put the page header bots in floating boxes?

correct about page to be more interesting and animated - big text, like jkr

refine the contents page

Change up and improve and simplify the copywriting on every pagecontinue compressing stuff as a lot of the thumbnails are slow

redesign the page you get welcomed to. - splash screen or video showreel

add in the thumbnail app icon idea that pan accross the bottom of the screen - in navigation of each page?

go back through coding html video watch list on youtube and look at other css tricks to find ways of making my website look beautiful

Add elements that scale horizontally outside of the 1280px borders

convert all my sizes to min width - or convert everything to clamp

Make the tags sortable

change the desctiption on every page to say I'm 21 not 20 - or reword this so i dont have to change it evert year

make sure images are in line with each other - eg if you have two images side by side make sure they stay the same size as each other
