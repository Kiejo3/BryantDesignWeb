        <p class="gap3 rSub">
            Welcome to plucked — a brand identity for a chicken rental company.
            This project was a live competition for university, set by the
            design agency Public London. We created the identify to be powerful,
            using vengeful chickens as the route for the design. <br /><br />
            This ideology created an unapologetically bold but fun personality
            for the brand that would both attract our target audience of
            families, while standing up for the mistreatment of chickens in the
            poultry industry — or as we like to put it — plucking chickens from
            their life sentence in poultry prison to go to happier homes.
        </p>

        <p class="lSub">
            When designing, we took inspiration from real chickens to create the
            brand elements for Plucked. The brand uses playful cartoon shapes
            designed from parts of a chicken, while the colours reflect the
            neutral pallete of a chicken.
        </p>

        <p class="gap4 rSub" style="align-self: flex-start">
            We created a custom, working typeface, by starting with a bold
            impactful typeface, but plucking the corners of each letter, to keep
            the impact of the font while becoming more playful. "Plucking"
            became the primary part of our design language and we used the
            effect in our animation.

        <p class="gap3 doubleCol">
            Instagram became our main way to interact with a younger,
            family-centred audience, which simultaneously allowed for the
            hypothetical brand to raise awareness for the mistreatment of
            chickens in the poultry industry.
        </p>

        <p class="gap3 doubleCol">
            We created stories and instagram posts that communicated our brand's
            energy, purpose and mission, using our fun Plucked shapes and colour
            palette to make a visually unique and captivating instagram page.
        </p>

        <p class="gap3 doubleCol">
            On top of the social media content, we created digestable
            infographics in the brand's style that communicated some of the
            horrific facts we found about the poultry industry while researching
            for the project.

            However, an online presence is only one way of reaching a potential
            audience. We realised that the chicken owners would also love
            getting out on adventures, so we created various out-of-home
            advertisements that we were sure would get people clucking.
        </p>
        <p class="gap3 tripleCol">
            We also considered what may arrive with your chicken, and how the
            brand may continue to interact with the custom after delivery. This
            meant contact cards, thank you letters, and even the vehicle it may
            be delivered in.

            When it came to presenting our work to the client — in this case the
            design agency, Public London — we made sure to consider all the
            small things in our brand that really made us stood out among our
            piers. This included custom T-shirts with our logos, a 3D printed
            chicken in a nest that we gave as a gift, and a presentation that
            left them without any feedback to give us.

/* AFTER I HAVE THIS WORKING: I NEED TO

0. Make this blurhash work stuff server side (it broke on upload)
1. Simplify the processes of calling this blurhash function - currently needs three functions: why?
2. rename the newblurhash call function to something shorter as it will be called a lot
3. shrink size of the images
4. test if multiple images work as they are currently using the same imgPlace id
5. implement it to all images on plucked
6. improve the image spaacing and vertical pacing.
7. add animation effects while scrolling and hovering throughout page
8. add background animation or different backgrounds or shapes
9. remove some of the waffley text
10. work on front cover
